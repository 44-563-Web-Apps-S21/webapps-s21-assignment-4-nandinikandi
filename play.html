    SCENE II. The sea-coast.
    Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors

    VIOLA
    What country, friends, is this?

    Captain
    This is Illyria, lady.

    VIOLA
    And what should I do in Illyria?
    My brother he is in Elysium.
    Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

    Captain
    It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

    VIOLA
    O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

    Captain
    True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
    Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
    When you and those poor number saved with you
    Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
    Most provident in peril, bind himself,
    Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
    To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
    Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
    I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
    So long as I could see.

    VIOLA
    For saying so, there's gold:
    Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
    Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
    The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

    Captain
    Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
    Not three hours' travel from this very place.

    VIOLA
    Who governs here?
