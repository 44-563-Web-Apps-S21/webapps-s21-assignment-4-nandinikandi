        Twelfth Night

    <h3>
        Act 1, Scene 2: The sea-coast.
    </h3>

    <h4>SCENE II. The sea-coast.</h4>
    <p>Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors</p>

    <h4>VIOLA</h4>
    <p>What country, friends, is this?</p>

    <h4>Captain</h4>
    <p>This is Illyria, lady.</p>

    <h4>VIOLA</h4>
    <p>And what should I do in Illyria?
    My brother he is in Elysium.
    Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?</p>

    <h4>Captain</h4>
    <p>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</p>

    <h4>VIOLA</h4>
    <p>O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.</p>

    <h4>Captain</h4>
    <p>True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
    Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
    When you and those poor number saved with you
    Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
    Most provident in peril, bind himself,
    Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
    To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
    Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
    I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
    So long as I could see.</p>

    <h4>VIOLA</h4>
    <p>For saying so, there's gold:
    Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
    Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
    The like of him. Know'st thou this country?</p>

    <h4>Captain</h4>
    <p>Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
    Not three hours' travel from this very place.</p>

    <h4>VIOLA</h4>
    <p>Who governs here?</p>
